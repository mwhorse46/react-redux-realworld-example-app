# ![React + Redux Example App](project-logo.png)

> Example React + Redux codebase that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld-example-apps) spec and API.

# Redux codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc)
Originally created for this [GH issue](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/issues/1353). The codebase is now feature complete; please submit bug fixes via pull requests & feedback via issues.

We're currently working on some docs for the codebase (explaining where functionality is located, how it works, etc) but most things should be self explanatory if you have a minimal understanding of React/Redux.

## Getting started

You can view a live demo over at https://react-redux.realworld.io/

To get the frontend running locally:

- Clone this repo
- `npm install` to install all req'd dependencies
- `npm start` to start the local server (this project uses create-react-app)

For convenience, we have a live API server running at https://conduit.productionready.io/api for the application to make requests against. You can view [the API spec here](https://github.com/GoThinkster/productionready/blob/master/API.md) which contains all routes & responses for the server. We'll release the backend code in a few weeks should anyone be interested in it.

## Functionality overview

The example application is a social blogging site (i.e. a Medium.com clone) called "Conduit". It uses a custom API for all requests, including authentication. You can view a live demo over at https://redux.productionready.io/

**General functionality:**

- Authenticate users via JWT (login/signup pages + logout button on settings page)
- CRU* users (sign up & settings page - no deleting required)
- CRUD Articles
- CR*D Comments on articles (no updating required)

- Favorite articles
- Follow other users

    - List of articles pulled from either Feed, Global, or by Tag
